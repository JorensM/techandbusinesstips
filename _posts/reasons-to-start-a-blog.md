Blogging is a nice side project and a hobby to have. It's easier than ever to start a blog, and you don't even have to invest any money to get started.

I think that many people have come across the idea of starting a blog. If you're currently considering it, then this article might just be for you!

Here are my top 4 reasons to start a blog:

* You learn from it
* Potential income
* You educate others
* You showcase your skills

## You learn from it

Blogging about a topic has several learning related benefits:

* **You gain knowledge.** When writing about a topic that you are not already knowledgable in, you will likely research about it which will lead to you learning about it and gaining knowledge.
* **You reinforce your existing knowledge.** One of the best ways to check if you know something is to try explaining it to someone. By writing about topic that you are skilled or somewhat skilled in, you reinforce your knowledge and can also find any potential gaps in your knowledge when researching the topic.
* **You improve your writing skills.** As a blog writer you will be constantly improving your writing skills, grammar, and vocubulary.

As you can see, blogging can bring you many knowledge-based benefits.

## Potential income

As your blog gains popularity, there open up several opportunities for creating a passive income stream from your blog.

  * **Affiliate marketing.** The most popular way of earning money with a blog is affiliate marketing, by which you market someone's product in your posts and earn a commissiom each time someone purchases their product through your blog.
  * **Ads.** Another popular way to earn money with your blog is to place ads on your blog through services like Google Adsense, and then any time someone clicks on an ad you earn a small amount of money.
  * **Memberships.** With this approach, you make some of your posts hidden behind a paywall that become available after the reader pays some amount of money for a subscription. There are many blogging platforms such as Medium, Substack, Patreon and BuyMeACoffee which make setting up memberships a breeze.

These are just some of the ways how you can earn money with blogging, and there are many more that are beyond the scope of this post.

## You educate other

By writing about topics that you are knowledgable in, or that you thoroughly have researched, you give an opportunity for others to learn from your articles.

## You showcase your skills

Lastly, writing about topics that you are skilled in allows you to showcase your skills and knowledge which lets potential employers get to know you and your expertise, which can open doors to new employment opportunities.

Many bloggers go as far as having a dedicated portfolio section in which they showcase their projects and skills. Some also do it the other way around, and put a blog on their portfolio website.

## Conclusion

As we've found out, blogging offers several benefits, namely learning, earning income, teaching others and showcasing your skills.

If before this you were unsure about whether you should start a blog, maybe now you have a clearer picture of the possibilities that blogging can offer you.
