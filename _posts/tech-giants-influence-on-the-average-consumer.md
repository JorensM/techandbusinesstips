I'm just your average Joe. I don't run a multi-million business and don't ride fancy cars. I'm also not a monk living in the mountains. Just a regular consumer, likely just like you. As an average consumer, I use a lot of different technologies - phone, computer, all the software that are on those devices. 

There are certain software products that I use most often - ones that have dominated my day-to-day attention. These software products are: 

 * Google
 * Social media like Reddit and Instagram
 * Developer software such as VSCode and GitHub

Over my lifetime, they have left both positive impacts on me, as well as left some scars that I'm still recovering from.

In this article we will explore the good and the bad effects that the corporate tech giants have had on our day-to-day lives. First we will discuss the general effects that all the tech giants have in common, and after that we will take a few of them and analyze them individually.

# Abudance of information

Probably the most apparent impact that all the tech giants and technology in general has left on society is the abudance of information. There is unlikely to be a thing that you can't type into Google that will bring up relevant results. Even typing something random, like 'asfgafg' can bring some results.

In my eyes, this can be both a good and a bad thing, but which one it is, depends on what information you consume and how much of it you consume.

There are good types of information online and bad types. Good types include anything that grows you 

**Information overload**, or a related term **Anaylsis paralysis** is when you have so much information at your disposal that you are paralyzed by the sheer amount of it, and in effect are unable to make a solid decision. To counter this, limit your consumption of information and only seek it when you truly can't figure it out yourself.
